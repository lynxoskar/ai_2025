# 5 Most Popular Agentic AI Design Patterns

This document summarizes the five key agentic AI design patterns outlined in a thread by Akshay ðŸš€ (@akshay_pachaar) on X, posted on April 2, 2025. These patterns illustrate how AI agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), can perform complex tasks autonomously by mimicking human-like problem-solving and collaboration.

## 1. Reflection Pattern

### Overview
The Reflection Pattern enables an AI to review and refine its own output iteratively. The LLM generates an initial response, critiques it for errors or gaps, and then improves it through multiple iterations. This self-critique process enhances the quality of outputs in tasks like coding, writing, or answering questions.

### Key Feature
- Self-evaluation and iteration for polished results.

    C --> D[LLM<br>Reflect]
    D -->|Iterate| C
    D --> E[Reflected Output]
    E --> A
*Diagram Description*: The visual shows a user sending a query to an LLM (Generate), which produces an initial output. This output is then reviewed by another LLM (Reflect), which iterates on the output until a refined response is sent back to the user.

## 2. Tool Use Pattern

### Overview
In the Tool Use Pattern, the LLM acts as the "brain" and uses external tools as its "hands" to perform actions. These tools can include querying a vector database, calling APIs, or executing Python scripts, allowing the AI to go beyond its internal knowledge.

### Key Feature
- Extends LLM capabilities through external tool integration.

    D --> A
*Diagram Description*: The diagram depicts a user sending a query to an LLM (Generate), which interacts with tools like a vector database or APIs. The LLM processes the tool output and sends a response back to the user.

## 3. ReAct Pattern (Reasoning and Acting)

### Overview
The ReAct Pattern combines Reflection and Tool Use. The AI reasons about its generated output, uses tools to interact with the external environment, and reflects on the results. This iterative process of reasoning and acting makes it a powerful approach for dynamic problem-solving.

### Key Feature
- Combines self-reflection with external tool interaction.

    G[Agent] --> B
*Diagram Description*: The visual shows a user query being processed by an LLM (Reason), which interacts with tools and the environment. The results are fed back to another LLM (Generate), which produces a response after reasoning and acting.

## 4. Planning Pattern

### Overview
The Planning Pattern focuses on breaking down complex tasks into smaller subtasks. The AI creates a roadmap by subdividing tasks and outlining objectives, executing each step methodically. It often leverages the ReAct pattern for individual subtasks.

### Key Feature
- Task decomposition and strategic execution.

### Visual

    D --> E{Finished?}
    E -->|NO| C
    E -->|YES| F[Response]
    F --> A
*Diagram Description*: The diagram illustrates a user query being processed by a Planner, which generates tasks. These tasks are executed by a ReAct Agent, with a decision loop ("Finished?") determining whether to continue or return a response to the user.

## 5. Multi-Agent Pattern

### Overview
The Multi-Agent Pattern involves multiple specialized AI agents working together, each with a distinct role. For example, in a software development scenario, agents might include a Product Manager (PM), Tech Lead, Developer, and DevOps Engineer, collaborating to deliver a unified product.

### Key Feature
- Collaborative teamwork among specialized agents.

*Diagram Description*: The visual shows a user query being handled by a team of agents (PM, Tech Lead, Developer, DevOps, SDE), with delegation arrows indicating collaboration. The final response is sent back to the user.

## Conclusion
These five agentic AI design patternsâ€”Reflection, Tool Use, ReAct, Planning, and Multi-Agentâ€”enable AI systems to perform complex tasks autonomously by mimicking human-like reasoning, planning, and collaboration. Each pattern builds on the capabilities of LLMs, making them more powerful and versatile for real-world applications.
